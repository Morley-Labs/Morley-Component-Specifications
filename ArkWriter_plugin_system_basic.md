# ArkWriter Plugin System - Basic Architecture Document

## Overview
This document outlines the preliminary architecture for a **plugin system** in ArkWriter, allowing external developers to extend its functionality with custom modules. The goal is to support **modular enhancements** while maintaining core stability.

## Purpose
- Enable **custom Ladder Logic operations, tools, and integrations**.
- Allow developers to create **exporters, validators, and automation extensions**.
- Keep ArkWriter **lean and adaptable** by separating non-core features into plugins.

## Potential Plugin Extension Points
1. **Ladder Logic Function Extensions**
   - Custom **logical operations**, advanced timers, and additional function blocks.
   - **Validation hooks** to enforce industry-specific compliance.

2. **Export & Integration Modules**
   - Plugins for exporting Ladder Logic to **external formats (JSON, CSV, proprietary formats, etc.).**
   - Integrations with **industrial automation systems or monitoring tools**.

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Additional **visual debugging tools**.
   - Custom **drag-and-drop elements** for specialized industries.

## Plugin Architecture Considerations
- **Security & Sandboxing:** Prevent **malicious plugins** from compromising core ArkWriter functionality.
- **Compatibility Management:** Ensure **backward compatibility** with future ArkWriter updates.
- **Configuration Management:** Allow users to **enable/disable** plugins from a **dedicated UI menu**.

## Next Steps
- Define a **plugin API** that standardizes how plugins interact with ArkWriter.
- Establish **security guidelines** for plugin execution.
- Prototype a **basic plugin loader** for testing external modules.
