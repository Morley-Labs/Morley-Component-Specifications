# ArkRedeem Specification

## Overview
ArkRedeem is a **UTXO migration and version tracking system** for **ArkWriter smart contracts**. It enables seamless **upgrades and migrations** of contract-locked UTXOs when new versions of smart contracts are deployed. By tracking **contract versions and UTXO states**, ArkRedeem ensures a smooth transition between contract iterations without disrupting user funds or data.

## Purpose
ArkRedeem is designed to:
- **Track Smart Contract Versions** → Identify which version of a smart contract a UTXO is associated with.
- **Enable UTXO Migration** → Provide a structured way to move locked UTXOs from **older contract versions** to **newer deployments**.
- **Enhance Contract Transparency** → Give users a clear view of **where their UTXOs are locked** and under what rules.
- **Streamline Upgrade Processes** → Ensure that users can transition between smart contract versions **without manual intervention or risk of loss**.

## Architecture
ArkRedeem consists of the following core components:

1. **Version Tracking System**
   - Stores a history of **deployed contract versions**.
   - Associates UTXOs with their **corresponding smart contract version**.
   - Provides **an auditable log** of contract upgrades and migrations.

2. **UTXO Migration Engine**
   - Allows users to **safely migrate UTXOs** to new contracts.
   - Ensures **compatibility between old and new contract logic**.
   - Facilitates **batch migrations** when multiple UTXOs need updating.

3. **User Interface for UTXO & Contract Tracking**
   - Displays **current contract versions** and their associated UTXOs.
   - Provides **visual feedback on migration status**.
   - Operates as a **separate window from the ArkWriter graphic editor**.

## Features
- **Smart Contract Versioning:** Maintain records of contract changes over time.
- **Automated UTXO Migration:** Seamlessly transition funds and state between contract versions.
- **Batch Processing Support:** Migrate multiple UTXOs efficiently.
- **Live Status Monitoring:** Track UTXOs in real-time to determine if migration is necessary.
- **Safe and Verified Upgrades:** Prevent unintended losses by validating migration paths before execution.

## Workflow
1. **Contract Deployment** → A new version of a smart contract is introduced.
2. **UTXO Tracking** → Users' UTXOs are mapped to their respective contract versions.
3. **Migration Evaluation** → ArkRedeem identifies UTXOs that need migration.
4. **Migration Execution** → Users trigger migration, moving UTXOs to the new contract.
5. **Completion & Verification** → Funds and contract states are successfully transferred.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with ArkWriter's Execution Flow** → To provide real-time migration status updates.
- **Automated Migration Recommendations** → Notify users when a UTXO is outdated and should be moved.
- **Extended Compatibility with Multiple Smart Contract Architectures** → Support **custom migration rules** based on contract logic.
