# ArkWriter Global Specification

## Overview
ArkWriter is a web-based IDE designed for creating, compiling, and deploying Ladder Logic-based smart contracts on Cardano. It provides an intuitive interface for engineers and developers to build, visualize, and manage automation logic while leveraging blockchain immutability and security.

## Architecture
ArkWriter follows a **modular architecture**, consisting of:
- **Frontend:** A TypeScript-based UI built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
- **Compiler Integration:** Converts Ladder Logic into Plutus smart contracts.
- **Wallet Connector:** Enables interaction with Cardano wallets for contract deployment.
- **Visualization Tools:** Graphical representation of Ladder Logic circuits and logic flow.

## Core Components
- **Editor Interface:** A drag-and-drop interface for creating Ladder Logic diagrams.
- **Code Processing:** Translates Ladder Logic into an Intermediate Representation (IR) for further processing.
- **Plutus Compilation:** Converts IR into executable Plutus scripts.
- **Contract Deployment:** Signs and submits transactions via a CIP-30 wallet connector.
- **Simulator:** Provides a real-time execution environment for testing Ladder Logic before deployment.

## Development Stack
- **Framework:** Vite + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Configuration:** ESLint, TypeScript configs (`tsconfig.json`)
- **Build System:** Vite
- **Version Control:** Git

## Future Expansion
ArkWriter is designed to support additional components such as ArkHunter and ArkTracer for deeper analysis and debugging. Future updates will introduce more industry-specific automation logic formats beyond Ladder Logic.
