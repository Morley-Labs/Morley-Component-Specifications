Morley Time Logic Specification

Goal
Support real-time execution (Hydra/Midgard/Sidechains) and slot-based enforcement (Cardano L1) while ensuring Plutus scripts can be compiled and reverse compiled into Ladder Logic.

Compiler (Ladder Logic → Plutus)
Features:
Convert Ladder Logic Timers into Plutus Constraints
Support Hydra/Midgard execution without L1 slot constraints 
Encode timestamps into datums when storing state on-chain

Example Transformation:
Ladder Logic Input:
```
TON Timer1, 5000ms
MOV state = state + 1
```
Compiled to Plutus:
```haskell
mustValidateIn (from slotX)
recordedTime `member` validTimeRange
```
If executing in Hydra/Midgard:
The compiler will *kip slot enforcement and instead encode time into a separate structure.



Reverse Compiler (Plutus → Ladder Logic)
Features:
Extract time logic from Plutus scripts & convert back to Ladder Logic. 
Interpret datums storing timestamps & state data.
Recognize real-time Hydra execution & adjust output accordingly.  

Example Transformation:
Plutus Input:
```haskell
mustValidateIn (from slotX)
```
Reverse Compiled into Ladder Logic:
```
TON Timer1, 5000ms
```
Plutus Datum Input:
```json
{"timestamp": 1700000000}
```
Reverse Compiled into Ladder Logic:
```
MOV timestamp = 1700000000
```



Anchoring Mechanism (Connecting Off-Chain to L1)
Features:
Hydra transactions store timestamps off-chain and verify them locally 
When needed, timestamps are committed to an L1 smart contract 
L1 validates that transactions respect original off-chain timing rules  

Example Flow:
Hydra executes transaction instantly**, timestamp recorded off-chain.
When final settlement is needed**, Hydra submits timestamp proof to L1.
L1 contract verifies timestamp against expected constraints** before allowing settlement.



ToDo
Development Priorities:
Extend the Morley Compiler to handle Plutus time constraints.
Extend the Morley Reverse Compiler to extract and interpret timestamps.
Define a standard format for encoding timestamps in datums for real-time execution.
Build the anchoring mechanism to connect Hydra/Midgard time logic to L1 slot constraints.
