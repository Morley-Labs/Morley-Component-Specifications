# Morley-Plutus Dual-Script Architecture Specification

Overview
This specification defines the dual-script architecture for Morley-Plutus contracts, enabling execution across Cardano L1 and automation-focused sidechains. The goal is to allow Morley smart contracts to operate in real-time on a sidechain while maintaining secure state validation and governance on L1.

Purpose
- Enable execution on both Cardano L1 and a sidechain.
- Ensure trustless state synchronization between both environments.
- Maximize adaptability across L1, Hydra, and custom automation chains.
- Allow bidirectional communication between L1 and the sidechain.

Architecture
The dual-script model consists of:

1. L1 Morley-Plutus Smart Contract
- Acts as the final validator for automation-related state transitions.
- Accepts state commitments from the sidechain and validates them.
- Provides an immutable audit log for off-chain automation processes.
- Can interact with Hydra Heads for batch execution efficiency.

2. Sidechain Morley-Plutus Smart Contract
- Executes Ladder Logic automation in real-time.
- Handles high-frequency, low-cost contract execution.
- Generates state commitment proofs to send back to L1 Morley-Plutus.
- Can operate fully independently, or in sync with L1 state validation.

Execution Workflow
1. Sidechain executes Morley contracts, allowing Ladder Logic automation to run in a high-speed environment.
2. State commitments are sent to L1, where the sidechain submits a proof of execution.
3. L1 verifies and finalizes state transitions, ensuring trustless execution.
4. The sidechain updates based on L1 feedback, preventing invalid transitions.

Trust Models
- Proof-of-Execution: The sidechain submits cryptographic proofs to L1.
- Periodic Checkpointing: The L1 contract receives batch updates.
- Validator-Based Bridging: The sidechain runs trusted Morley validators, ensuring L1 consensus is upheld.

Interoperability Considerations
- Hydra Integration: Hydra can be used to batch Morley state updates before they are committed to L1.
- Midgard Compatibility: If Midgard or another sidechain is used, it must support Plutus execution.
- Custom Morley Bridge: If existing Cardano sidechain bridges are insufficient, a custom Morley bridge will be designed.

Future Enhancements
- Adaptive execution models based on network conditions.
- Automated L1-sidechain governance for Morley state validation.
- Expansion to non-Cardano chains if needed for enterprise adoption.
