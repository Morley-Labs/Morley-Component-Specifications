# Morley Execution Simulator - Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design of a **Ladder Logic execution simulator** for Morley. Unlike ArkTracer (which focuses on debugging individual Plutus scripts), this simulator is designed to **test the execution of complex, multi-contract automation workflows**.

## Purpose
- **Predict system performance** before on-chain deployment.
- **Test interactions between multiple Ladder Logic contracts**.
- **Validate execution under different network conditions.**
- **Identify potential race conditions and bottlenecks.**

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time & Slot-Based Execution Support**
   - Handle **real-time automation flows** for Hydra/Midgard.
   - Test **slot-based execution constraints** on Cardano L1.

2. **Parallel Execution Testing**
   - Simulate multiple Ladder Logic contracts **executing in parallel**.
   - Identify unintended **state dependencies or conflicts**.

3. **Historical Network Data Integration**
   - Allow simulations to use **real-world historical Cardano conditions**.
   - Validate contracts against **real transaction loads and slot speeds**.

4. **Automated Stress Testing**
   - Run **high-load scenarios** to test contract performance under stress.
   - Detect **failure points and execution slowdowns**.

## Workflow
1. **Load Ladder Logic Contracts** → Import one or more Morley Ladder Logic scripts.
2. **Configure Execution Parameters** → Select **execution mode, concurrency settings, and network conditions**.
3. **Run Simulation** → Observe how contracts interact over multiple execution cycles.
4. **Analyze & Debug Results** → Identify **execution flow issues and inefficiencies**.

## Next Steps
- Define **initial execution engine logic**.
- Integrate with **ArkTracer’s debugging stack**.
- Develop a **prototype simulator UI**.
