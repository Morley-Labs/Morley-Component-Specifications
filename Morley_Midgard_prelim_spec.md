Morley-Midgard Sidechain Specification

Overview
This document outlines a preliminary specification for deploying Morley-Plutus contracts on a Midgard-based sidechain. While this implementation is not immediate, this specification provides a foundation that can be modified as Midgard evolves.

Purpose
- Provide a scalable execution environment for Morley contracts outside Cardano L1 constraints.
- Ensure bidirectional interaction between Morley-Plutus on L1 and a Midgard-based sidechain.
- Allow high-frequency Ladder Logic execution while maintaining security and verifiability on L1.

Architecture
The Morley-Midgard sidechain model consists of:

1. Morley Execution on Midgard
- Runs Morley-Plutus scripts natively on a Midgard-based sidechain.
- Optimized for fast transaction processing and deterministic execution.
- Supports Ladder Logic operations without L1 block time constraints.

2. L1 Morley-Plutus Validation Layer
- Receives periodic state commitments from the Morley sidechain.
- Ensures that off-chain execution adheres to defined Plutus constraints.
- Acts as a final settlement layer for Morley sidechain transactions.

3. Morley-Midgard Bridge
- Facilitates the movement of data and assets between L1 and the Morley sidechain.
- Uses cryptographic proofs to validate state changes before L1 finalization.
- Can interact with Hydra for off-chain transaction batching before L1 submission.

Execution Workflow
1. Morley contracts are deployed and executed on a Midgard-based sidechain.
2. Periodic state commitments are sent to L1 for verification.
3. The L1 Morley-Plutus contract verifies execution integrity.
4. Confirmed state updates are stored on L1 for auditability.

Interoperability Considerations
- Midgard compatibility ensures that Morley contracts remain Plutus-compliant.
- The Morley-Midgard bridge will support trustless state synchronization.
- Interaction with Hydra will allow Morley executions to be batched before L1 commitments.

Future Enhancements
- Define specific performance benchmarks for Morley on Midgard.
- Establish governance rules for cross-chain execution validation.
- Expand compatibility with alternative execution environments beyond Midgard.
